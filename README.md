# Advent of Code 2021

Repository for solving the Advent of Code daily challenges in C++ (probably badly). I'm using CMakeLists to build the make files and I'm compiling with g++ in Arch Linux. I'm not bothering to keep the build files, just the code and executables. Each days solution should build fine if you want to build them. Just navigate to the build directory on the day of interest, run

`` cmake ..``

Then, just run

``make && ./main``.
